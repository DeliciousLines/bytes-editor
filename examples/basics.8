======================
**** Introduction ****
======================
This editor's goal is to let you control its behaviour in the least restrictive way possible and also to keep things as simple and unified as possible.
We do not want you to deal with regex soup, 3 different formats to store settings, external toolchains and hope everything is fast enough in the end.
In order to solve this problem we let you program the editor through a single layer that directly runs on your CPU. This custom layer is used for everything,
from settings to themes, to syntax highlighting and to text insertion and navigation.


==========================
**** The custom layer ****
==========================
The custom layer is controlled using a programming language that is statically checked and compiled to machine code for greater efficiency. We will try to help
you learn how to use this language to control the editor's behaviour throughout these examples (for now we assume you have some programming experience).
The editor accesses the custom layer from a file named custom.8 that is placed in the same folder as the editor executable. The code to interface with the editor
is contained in api.8; this file is automatically injected by the compiler so that you do not need to explicitly include it in the code base.


================
**** Tokens ****
================
The editor has a buit-in mechanism to parse text and extract elements from it known as tokens. A token can be a number, a word, a quote, etc.
Since version 0.3.0 the editor does *not* tokenise the whole file. It is now up to you to retrieve tokens from specific text regions.

To check the types of tokens available, read the Token_Type enum in api.8
Here is some information for selected token types:
- Numbers: Bytes is quite loose as to how numbers are represented to cover as many cases as possible. Here are some examples: .23, 0xffa, 2.3f, 45ull
- Miscellaneous tokens: the following are considered miscellaneous: , . ; \ @ # $ => -> <- :: := 
- Math operators (this includes bitwise operators): >>>= <<<= <<= >>= ++ -- += -= *= /= %= &= |= ^= + - * / % & | ~ ^
- Logical operators: &&= ||= === !== <== >== && || >= <= != == ! ? > <

Note that token types can be overridden by tokenisation hints (for now only tokens related to comments override the rest).


=============================
**** Custom layer blocks ****
=============================
A custom layer handles three aspects: settings, syntax highlighting and navigation/text-editing.
As a result there are three different blocks of code executed for each of these.

Make sure to check declarations.8, complex_types.8, flow_control.8 and sub_programs.8 to familiarise yourself with the language basics.
Also check api.8 which contains the API reference and lets you interface with the editor.

#on_load {
    /*
    
    This block is executed every time the custom layer is loaded/reloaded. This is were you typically store and set settings.
    For more information check the on_load.8 file.
    
    */
}

#syntax {
    /*
    
    This block is executed every time the editor needs to update syntax highlighting.
    For more information check the syntax.8 file.
    
    */
}

#events {
    /*
    
    This block is executed every time events happen in the editor (key strokes for the most part). You can use these events to navigate through the editor or
    through a text file.
    For more information check the events.8 file.
