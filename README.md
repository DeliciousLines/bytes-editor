### Limitations
- Bytes is not an IDE
- Bytes is not currently designed to work with big files

### Beta disclaimer

### Roadmap to 1.0.0 (in no particular order)
- Make a MacOS port
- Fix bugs
- Enhance the documentation
- Support more VT100 sequences
- Speed-up some parts of the editor
- Lower memory consumption
- Output higher quality machine code
- Stabilise the API
- Make a hexadecimal editor?
